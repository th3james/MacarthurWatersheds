      <header>What is the Watershed Evaluation Tool?</header>
      <p>The Watershed Evaluation Tool allows watersheds to be compared for their biodiversity and ecosystem function importance, for current (2005) and future (2050) scenarios in three tropical regions: the Great Lakes region of Africa, the Mekong Basin in South-East Asia and the Andes in South America.</p>

      <header>Why was the tool made?</header>
      <p>Land conversion and intensification of agricultural systems seem unavoidable and likely to result in loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. The MacArthur Foundation funded research by UNEP-WCMC to address the urgent need to understand trade-offs between land uses, and to provide such information and analyses to stakeholders and decision makers. This study combines future scenarios with land use modelling, to evaluate priorities for conservation or other actions, in order to balance demands on land for regions characterised by high biodiversity and poverty.</p> 
      <p>The project aims to: i) provide a baseline to assess future impacts of development and ii) identify current and potential future priorities to inform activities of stakeholders, in relation to impacts of major commodity markets on biodiversity and ecosystem functions.</p>

      <header>How were results produced for this tool?</header>
      <ul>
        <li>Analysis was carried out using i) <a href="/data/global_geo4_scenarios.pdf" target="_blank">global</a> and ii) <a href="/data/regionally_developed_scenarios.pdf" target="_blank">regionally</a> developed scenarios of change.</li>
        <li>These scenarios were used as a basis for land use modelling using LandSHIFT to produce land cover outputs for current and future time periods.</li>
        <li>The LandSHIFT model considers drivers of land use change such as population change, trends in commodity markets and agricultural production, in addition to land cover data from GLC-2000. Watershed importance values were derived from linking the land cover outputs from land use modelling, to biodiversity and ecosystem functions.</li>
        <li>Biodiversity importance was based on IUCN species ranges for amphibians, mammals and birds in combination with their habitat affiliations and modelled land cover.</li> 
        <li>Ecosystem function importance was based on a landscape functions approach and modelled land cover.</li>
      </ul>

      <header>What should the tool not be used for?</header>
      <p>The results for the watersheds in this tool are not comparable between the three regions or between global and regional scenarios. Results represent mean values for watersheds and thus may not reflect realities at local scales.</p>
